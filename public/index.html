  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a full-time software engineer, having my legs do nothing all day but atropy has not been helping my legs’ health - namely my knees’ health. So this week I spent big money ($6) at the local hardware store on 4 cinder-blocks. I converted my normal desk into a standing-desk to see if I liked it at all. I’ve heard differing opinions on the standing desk ranging from “foot fatigue” to “hated it”. If you’re thinking about a standing desk, hopefully this will server as another datapoint in your research.</p>

<h2 id="macgyver">MacGyver</h2>
<p>The first part was actually converting my desk into a standing desk. One of my coworkers on the project I’m currently working on had already converted his normal desk to a standing desk using cinder blocks, but I never really wanted to touch his desk for fear of it falling over. I can happily say that I trust my desk just as much sitting on top of four stone blocks as I do sitting on the floor. No issues with stability and the height is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>
<p>Standing while working is definitely odd at first. It took me a little while to find a foot position that worked for me while standing. It also helped that there was an extra bar-stool just hanging around our project pod that I swiped for myself. When my legs or feet get even remotely tired or uncofortable, I simply sit in my bar stool. Since the bar stool has just a small chair back, it forces me to sit more upright. Also, since the chair is so high off the ground, it prevents me from putting my leg underneath the other, which is usually my default sitting position and is also pretty terrible on your knees. Ballpark standing percentage: 60% standing - standing-desk doesn’t have to be a full-time standing affair.</p>

<h2 id="socialization">Socialization</h2>
<p>The other large difference I noticed from having a normal desk was that whenever someone had a question and came up to your desk, you were both already at the same level. The desk “guest” didn’t have to find a chair nor did they have to kneel down to look at your monitor. You’re both naturally at the same level looking at the same thing. I think it very much encourages others to come check out what you’re doing and ask questions.</p>

<h2 id="rise">Rise</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about a standing desk and your employer will allow it, try out cinder blocks and a taller chair to see it it’s something you might like to do on a full-time basis.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone makes at least some attempt at resolutions each new year - even if they say they “don’t make resolutions”. How can you go through life without goals to better yourself as a person? Based on my past, though, we very often do not write them down or forget about them entirely before the end of January.</p>

<p>The problem with goals of mine in the past have always been that they are very generic and/or very difficult to satisfy. I have made a deliberate effort to make my goals for this year both small and specific. This will make it much more difficult to justify my way out of satisfying my goals for this year and much easier to satisfy more goals is they are more achievable.</p>

<h2 id="achievement-unlocked">Achievement Unlocked</h2>
<p>So, in the spirit of both personal growth and gamification, I bring you <a href="/blog/Achievements/index.html">a new page</a> with my personal list<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of “achievements” for 2013 that look like this:</p>

<div class="achievement">
  <div>
    <img class="achievement-image" src="/images/achievements/book-lines-2.png" />
  </div>
  <div class="achievement-contents">
      <h2>Read three non-technical books</h2>
      <div>I don&#8217;t read enough. I read plenty of technical content, but not near enough book-books (some rare individuals call this &#8220;fun&#8221; reading).
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Drive-What-Says-About/dp/0307277194">Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</a> - Tom Vanderbilt</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="progressbar">
        <div id="three-non-technical"></div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Achievements must be:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Specific</strong> - Specific goals have less room to be “justified” by you as “technically” completed. Examples include “Learn C”, “Run More”, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantifiable</strong> - This goes with being specific. This makes it very clear as to the completion of your achievement. Did you <code>&lt;insert achievement title&gt;</code>? Yes? Achievement unlocked. Easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Achievable</strong> - If you’re a brand new engineer now, your goal should <em>not</em> be to become director of your department this year.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What About You?</h2>
<p>So what are <em>your</em> 2013 achievements? Feel free to steal mine <a href="/blog/Achievements/index.html">here</a> if you so choose.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I’ve obviously omitted the truly personal achievements about my life like friends, family, etc.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: Cocoapods is all very new and in rapid development (currently v0.16.1 as of this writing), if you are in the know and any of the below is wrong or incorrect, please let me know and I’ll change it.</em></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/cocoapods/cocoapods_logo.png" width="200" height="200" />If you’re reading this there is a good chance you have at least heard of <a href="http://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a>. For the uninitiated, Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Mac and iOS projects built on Ruby and based on the Ruby community’s “<a href="http://gembundler.com">rubygem bundler</a>”. Each “pod” has a “spec” that is utilized in order to know how to integrate a given component with your project and resolve any dependencies your project may have with other libraries. I’ll be referring to these from here on out as either a “podspec” or more simply - a “spec”.</p>

<p>Since I’ve had some trouble easily writing my podspecs in the past (and have run into poorly-tested specs in the specs repository), I have put together a collection of knowledge on the things I have learned while building and testing my podspecs.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="roots">Roots</h2>
<p>When I originally built LARSAdController, I was building it to fulfill a very specific purpose for my first app (Droid Light): leverage a singleton to serve a single ad instance for iAds using best practices, and serve AdMob ads as a backup when iAds (stellar) inventory ran dry. Since then, I’ve expanded it to support multiple devices, as well as multiple orientations, all while being super-easy to integrate.</p>

<h2 id="section">3.0</h2>
<p>Version 3.0 now supports all of the things that the old version did, but now allows you much more flexibility and freedom in how you would like your ads to be used.</p>

<h3 id="major-changes-from-v2x">Major Changes from v2.x</h3>

<p>A detailed changelog of what has changed can be found in the <a href="/blog/2012/12/15/larsadcontroller-3-dot-0-rc/">LARSAdController 3.0 release-candidate post</a>, but here’s the <code>tl;dr</code> version:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>TOL</code> as a new class prefix</li>
  <li>Arbitrary ad networks</li>
  <li>Ad network priority</li>
  <li>Conversion to ARC</li>
  <li>Presentation types</li>
  <li>Pinning locations (have ad reside at the top of your view)</li>
  <li>Easy setup with a new view controller subclass <code>TOLAdViewController</code></li>
  <li>Optional verbose debug logging for development</li>
  <li>Upgrade base iOS dependency to iOS 5.0</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="easy-integration">Easy Integration</h2>
<p>So let’s get started integrating your ad with some ad networks. If you would like to use Google as your ad vendor, then you will need to go ahead and setup an account with them and have your publisher ID handy.</p>

<p>This is going to be so stupid simple it’s going to blow your mind<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Edit Jan 10, 2013: Since publishing this post, <a href="/blog/2013/01/10/stupid-easy-ads-with-larsadcontroller-3-dot-0/">LARSAdController v3.0 has been pushed to the master branch</a> on <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController/">github</a>!</em></p>

<p>I’ve been working hard on refactoring <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController/tree/2.1.1">LARSAdController 2.0</a> into a more modular and maintainable state over the past few months. I think it’s finally in a place that could warrant some final testing from other developers before being merged into the master branch. </p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what’s changed:</p>

<h2 id="a-new-class-prefix">A New Class Prefix</h2>
<p>I’ve been using the class prefix <code>LARS</code> for all of my open-source classes. While this really is short and unique, it’s always felt pretty egotistical to have my name plastered all over my classes. This is just how I feel from this side of the keyboard. Does it look the same from the user’s end? Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve migrated new classes to the new <code>TOL</code> prefix, for <a href="https://twitter.com/theonlylars">@<strong>T</strong>he<strong>O</strong>nly<strong>L</strong>ars</a>. This feels more anonymous and I haven’t seen the prefix used by anyone else before, yet. I’d love to know if someone well known <em>is</em> using the <code>TOL</code> class prefix. If I feel like I like this prefix better, I may just start using it for everything.</p>

<p>I also like that it sounds like “toll”. I have grand visions of having some cool project named <code>TOLBooth</code>, <code>TOLRoad</code>, or <code>TOLHouse</code>. I can’t think of practical project ideas to put those names on, however.</p>

<h2 id="modular-ad-networks">Modular Ad Networks</h2>
<p>The big new feature for this release is modular ad networks. Ad junkies will know this as ad mediation. AdMob has an ad mediation framework, so does AdWhirl, MobClix, and others. This is my implementation. The actual mediation logic is in a single .h/.m file pair. The other files support the ad networks. I feel this is a very lightweight implementation compared to other company’s mediation platforms, not to mention it’s open source so you can peek under the hood to see how another developer has solved a problem.</p>

<p>Right now I’ve built ad network adapters for iAds and AdMob ads. These are the only two ad networks that I use in Droid Light, so I don’t know much about others, and these two seem to be the most popular for banner ads on iOS.</p>

<h3 id="house-ads">House Ads</h3>
<p>A third planned adapter I’m particularly excited about is an adapter for “house” ads, <em>but I have not started on it as of yet</em>. House ads would basically amount to an image and a tap destination that you supply yourself. It’s an ad for yourself. </div>
