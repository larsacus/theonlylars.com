  <div class="entry-content"><p>A coworker recently asked me at the end of last week what I thought, based on my experience on my last iOS 6-only project, would be the best approach to starting to learn and work with autolayout. He was specifically asking if he should bother working with xib files, or simply layout everything in code. He then asked that if he were to go with a xib file, what the best approach would be to balance the time/effort workflow for autolayout.</p>

<p>All of the below is 100% based on my experience on my last project that was iOS 6-only, where autolayout was extensively utilized.</p>

<h2 id="autolayout-layout-construction-priority">Autolayout Layout Construction Priority</h2>
<p>Apple states in all of their documentation the following order you should begin implementing autolayout:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nib file</li>
  <li>Visual formatting language</li>
  <li>Individual constraints</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="to-nib">To NIB</h2>
<p>The priority above is, in my opinion, very dependent on what you are working on. If you have a pretty trivial layout that is simply being constrained based on something simple like an orientation change, then a xib file will probably be your best bet for a rapid layout that is unambiguous and doesn’t give you any issue during maintenance with very little effort.</p>

<p>Another very helpful feature of autolayout’s constraints is the fact that you can create an outlet to a single constraint. You can use this outlet to easily animate a change, change the constraints constant, or remove a constraint altogether without much additional effort. To animation a constraint change, simply update your constraint(s), call <code>-setNeedsLayout</code>, then call <code>-layoutIfNeeded</code> in an animation block. Very quick and easy.</p>

<h3 id="no-touching">No Touching</h3>
<p><a href="/images/no_touching.gif"><img class="right" src="/images/no_touching_static.jpg" width="300" /></a> However, using xibs for autolayout starts to break down and become more time than it’s worth when you get into complex layouts that depend on cross-view constraints, constraints depending on a view’s content or complex constraint sets relating to many physically smaller views (the constraints simply become an absolute nightmare to <em>physically</em> click on and manage in the xib without screwing something else up).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a full-time software engineer, having my legs do nothing all day but atrophy has not been helping my legs’ health - namely my knees’ health. So this week I spent big money ($6) at the local hardware store on 4 cinder-blocks. I converted my normal desk into a standing-desk to see if I liked it at all. I’ve heard differing opinions on the standing desk ranging from “foot fatigue” to “hated it”. If you’re thinking about a standing desk, hopefully this will server as another datapoint in your research.</p>

<h2 id="macgyver">MacGyver</h2>
<p>The first part was actually converting my desk into a standing desk. One of my coworkers on the project I’m currently working on had already converted his normal desk to a standing desk using cinder blocks, but I never really wanted to touch his desk for fear of it falling over. I can happily say that I trust my desk just as much sitting on top of four stone blocks as I do sitting on the floor. No issues with stability and the height is perfect.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone makes at least some attempt at resolutions each new year - even if they say they “don’t make resolutions”. How can you go through life without goals to better yourself as a person? Based on my past, though, we very often do not write them down or forget about them entirely before the end of January.</p>

<p>The problem with goals of mine in the past have always been that they are very generic and/or very difficult to satisfy. I have made a deliberate effort to make my goals for this year both small and specific. This will make it much more difficult to justify my way out of satisfying my goals for this year and much easier to satisfy more goals is they are more achievable.</p>

<h2 id="achievement-unlocked">Achievement Unlocked</h2>
<p>So, in the spirit of both personal growth and gamification, I bring you <a href="/blog/Achievements/index.html">a new page</a> with my personal list<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> of “achievements” for 2013 that look like this:</p>

<div class="achievement">
  <div>
    <img class="achievement-image" src="/images/achievements/book-lines-2.png" />
  </div>
  <div class="achievement-contents">
      <h2>Read three non-technical books</h2>
      <div>I don&#8217;t read enough. I read plenty of technical content, but not near enough book-books (some rare individuals call this &#8220;fun&#8221; reading).
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Drive-What-Says-About/dp/0307277194">Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</a> - Tom Vanderbilt</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="progressbar">
        <div id="three-non-technical"></div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Achievements must be:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Specific</strong> - Specific goals have less room to be “justified” by you as “technically” completed. Examples include “Learn C”, “Run More”, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantifiable</strong> - This goes with being specific. This makes it very clear as to the completion of your achievement. Did you <code>&lt;insert achievement title&gt;</code>? Yes? Achievement unlocked. Easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Achievable</strong> - If you’re a brand new engineer now, your goal should <em>not</em> be to become director of your department this year.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What About You?</h2>
<p>So what are <em>your</em> 2013 achievements? Feel free to steal mine <a href="/blog/Achievements/index.html">here</a> if you so choose.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I’ve obviously omitted the truly personal achievements about my life like friends, family, etc. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Update 4-15-2013: Updated for changes that came with v0.18.x and v0.17 since this page is now linked to on <a href="http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/index.html">cocoapods.org</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: Cocoapods is all very new and in rapid development (currently v0.18.1 as of this update), if you are in the know and any of the below is wrong or incorrect, please let me know and I’ll change it.</em></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/cocoapods/cocoapods_logo.png" width="200" height="200" />If you’re reading this there is a good chance you have at least heard of <a href="http://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a>. For the uninitiated, Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Mac and iOS projects built on Ruby and based on the Ruby community’s “<a href="http://gembundler.com">rubygem bundler</a>”. Each “pod” has a “spec” that is utilized in order to know how to integrate a given component with your project and resolve any dependencies your project may have with other libraries. I’ll be referring to these from here on out as either a “podspec” or more simply - a “spec”.</p>

<p>Since I’ve had some trouble easily writing my podspecs in the past (and have run into poorly-tested specs in the specs repository), I have put together a collection of knowledge on the things I have learned while building and testing my podspecs.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="roots">Roots</h2>
<p>When I originally built LARSAdController, I was building it to fulfill a very specific purpose for my first app (Droid Light): leverage a singleton to serve a single ad instance for iAds using best practices, and serve AdMob ads as a backup when iAds (stellar) inventory ran dry. Since then, I’ve expanded it to support multiple devices, as well as multiple orientations, all while being super-easy to integrate.</p>

<h2 id="section">3.0</h2>
<p>Version 3.0 now supports all of the things that the old version did, but now allows you much more flexibility and freedom in how you would like your ads to be used.</p>

<h3 id="major-changes-from-v2x">Major Changes from v2.x</h3>

<p>A detailed changelog of what has changed can be found in the <a href="/blog/2012/12/15/larsadcontroller-3-dot-0-rc/">LARSAdController 3.0 release-candidate post</a>, but here’s the <code>tl;dr</code> version:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>TOL</code> as a new class prefix</li>
  <li>Arbitrary ad networks</li>
  <li>Ad network priority</li>
  <li>Conversion to ARC</li>
  <li>Presentation types</li>
  <li>Pinning locations (have ad reside at the top of your view)</li>
  <li>Easy setup with a new view controller subclass <code>TOLAdViewController</code></li>
  <li>Optional verbose debug logging for development</li>
  <li>Upgrade base iOS dependency to iOS 5.0</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="easy-integration">Easy Integration</h2>
<p>So let’s get started integrating your ad with some ad networks. If you would like to use Google as your ad vendor, then you will need to go ahead and setup an account with them and have your publisher ID handy.</p>

<p>This is going to be so stupid simple it’s going to blow your mind<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</div>
