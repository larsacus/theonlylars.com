  <div class="entry-content"><p>When iOS 6 was announced, one of the lesser features was a “Smart” App Banner that displayed unobtrusively over your webpage and displayed an app that users could directly download on the app store from your webpage.  After the keynote, I forgot to investigate the documentation about it all through the iOS 6 Beta and never really heard much about it until the GM release of iOS 6.  So I went to check out how to do this thinking it was going to be super-involved, at least html-wise.</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="html"><span class="line"><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;apple-itunes-app&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;app-id=379660205&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>That’s it.  Add this meta tag to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your website template. Then, replace your app ID with the one iTunes Connect displays for your app in the app details.</p>

<p>If you’re on an iOS 6 device, then you will see this at the top of this webpage:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/smartbanners/droidlightbanner.png" /></p>

<p>When the user taps on the banner, iOS will take the user to the app store to complete the transaction.  When the user returns to your website, a progress indicator will display showing the progress of the app install.  After the download and installation is complete, the banner’s action will launch the app.</p>

<p>You can even go one or two steps further and pass in affiliate link information when your app gets downloaded or have information passed to your app on first launch in the app’s url handling delegate method.  More detail can be found in the documentation on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#Documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html">Apple’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re running an <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> blog and aren’t sure where to make this change to include it in your blog, mosey on over to <code>source\_includes\head.html</code> and add it in with the rest of the <code>&lt;meta</code> tags. </p>

<p>I’ve installed it on my blog with a link to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/droid-light-customizable-flashlight/id379660205?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Droid Light</a>, since that’s the only personal app I have that actually moves any units on the app store.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the US today, it is what our government has deemed “Labor Day”.  This holiday is marked (at least from what I see here in Texas) by beer, boats, and barbecue. If you live here in Austin - it also means you better not expect to get in your car and get anywhere anytime soon. If you work at any retail establishment, it means you’re being paid 1.5x today and will have the busiest day second only to black friday (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day#Retail_Sale_Day">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>I, however, simply enjoyed family, food, and taking my bike to the park to get dirty on the trails. Still really out of shape, but that’s kind of to be expected when you spend 8-12 hours a day hunched in front of a computer 5-6 days out of the week.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve had my rest, I’m going to get back to doing what I do best - building.</p>

<p>Now go forth and build - I don’t care what it is. Bonus points for being the one who broke it to begin with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="in-review">In Review</h2>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2012/07/02/ditching-nslog-advanced-ios-logging-part-1/">Part I of Ditching <code>NSLog</code></a>, we introduced our good friend <code>NSLog</code> and why there is a time and a place for him, but that those are few and far between.  We also discussed the different types of logging, and why you might want to use them, as well as how <code>NSLog</code>, in general, cannot satisfy these requirements.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll go over some of the options you have available in your developer tool-belt to make your tasks easier to tackle. I always tell myself that good tools (or even <em>the</em> proper tool) make building things much easier.  The same is true for building an app as it is for building my new bike I have sitting in pieces in the garage. Obtain and use the correct tools, and you’ll be more likely to produce a solid product.</p>

<p><em>Pre-Disclaimer: My original intent for the second part of this post was to actually <strong>use</strong> every library before writing about them.  I found so many different libraries, that this never actually ended up happening.  I present here a synopsis of each logging library on the basis that I have used some of them, but I have not used them all.  Blame my day job and Battlefield 3. Yes, I am weak.</em></p>

<h2 id="logging-libraries">Logging Libraries</h2>
<p>###Simple Macro Replacement
While not really a “library” per se, this <em>method</em> is the most basic of all the options that will be listed here and will only get you part of the way to logging nerdvana. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every iOS developer has used <code>NSLog</code>. We use it as a debugging tool to see the what data the system sees at a particular time while the application is running, or even to track the path our data takes when moving through our applications. But <code>NSLog</code> is not the be-all, end-all logging mechanism many of you think it is.</p>

<p>If you’re new to iOS, you may want to sit this one out until you get annoyed by <code>NSLog</code> - then come back here and read this.</p>

<h2 id="i-use-nslog-and-i-think-its-awesome-isnt-that-enough">I Use NSLog and I think it’s awesome. Isn’t that enough?</h2>
<p>Umm… Let me count the ways. You may think of <code>NSLog</code> as your awesome friend with the boat who lets you join him on the weekends, but in reality he’s that guy on a Friday afternoon at the bank who’s exchanging three years worth of saved coins and asking about the interest rates on free checking accounts. I hate that guy. </p>

<p>There are more forces at work than you might think operating behind the scenes in order to get your log messages to both the console and into Xcode console log. Let’s go over some of the issues I have with <code>NSLog</code>:</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p><code>NSLog</code> is slow. This wouldn’t be so bad if it were asynchronous - but it is most definitely very synchronous. This is why you can set a breakpoint, step through your code and instantly see your <code>NSLog</code> statements show up in the console after you step over them. Make enough calls with <code>NSLog</code> in highly-iterative, performance-oriented or <code>drawRect:</code> code and the performance-penalty begins to add up. This is also not to say that we don’t sometimes need a synchronous logging mechanism. After all - if your code is in an unstable state, wouldn’t you want to know about both synchronously and immediately?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WWDC was a ton of fun.  One of my coworkers equated it to drinking from a fire-hose all week, and that’s exactly what it was like - hardly any time to process any of what you’re taught all week. The sessions were really good, being surrounded by others who do what you do was inspiring, and the labs gave me access to Apple engineers to ask them whatever I wanted.  I got some really good feedback on my <a href="http://larsacus.github.com/LARSAdController">iOS ad integration class</a>, as well as some help integrating auto layout with some existing projects. There is a ton of material that is not mentioned in the videos (and sometimes even in the documentation) about how a class functions or was built. This is when access to the engineers that actually build the API is infinitely useful.  I’ll definitely be more prepared next year.</p>

<p>For those wondering, the WWDC minty boost <em>did</em> in fact work to charge my devices (which was totally necessary every single day), but heated up the AA’s due to the current draw and re-melted the hot-glue that was protecting the PCB to the battery chassis. I only got one use out of it, but really didn’t need it any longer once you know to plug your phone in to charge at every opportunity.</p>

<p>It also humbles me as an engineer to be surrounded by so many people from all over the world who have gone on to do such publicly “great” things by comparison to what I feel like I’ve done.  Most of the work I do can’t be shown to anyone else as <em>my</em> work, so I often find myself longing for a very public application or open source project to put my name on. Something I can say that <em>I</em> built or had a significant impact in building and it’s something that millions of others love and find useful. All good things come in time to those who work hard, so we’ll see where the next few years takes me. But for someone who really likes being openly proud of his work instead of just knowing intrinsically that I worked on something public, private white-label consulting is difficult for me - at least in that way. I’m not entirely sure how I would do in a single-project setting where the company I worked for <em>was</em> the product and I wasn’t able to bounce around multiple projects if I wanted to, but I’m sure I would manage just fine.</p>
