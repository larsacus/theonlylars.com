    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of all of the lists I have read about what to bring with you to WWDC, or suggestions on what veterans say you should do, the most consistent and unanimously present suggestion from all sources is that you will need to extend the battery life of your mobile device.  In the case of WWDC, there is a 99.99 (repeating, of course)% chance that it will be an iPhone. Being a procrastinator, I did not order one online like I should have from monoprice or similar.  Being a cheap, stingy software engineer, I refused to pay between $60-$100 for similar Li-Ion battery packs that carry anywhere from 3000-6500mAh of power. Being an electrical engineer by schooling, you tend to have <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/">stuff like this lying around the house</a>. Specifically, I had the minty boost powering an Arduino/Xbee assembly that is feeding temperature data from my HVAC exaust to Cosm.  You can read all about <em>that</em> <a href="http://theonlylars.com/homedata">here</a>. It ultimately didn&#8217;t work for this application due to it&#8217;s limited supply time (only lasted about 6 hours at a time).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://theonlylars.com/images/posts/mintyboost/minty-boost-1.jpg"> This will enable me to use two rechargeable AA batteries at a time to at least get my iDevice back on it&#8217;s feet. I don&#8217;t intend for this to get me to a full charge, but it should suffice to get me to the next wall outlet.</p>

<p>Also, since Altoids does not make the Altoids gum that the Minty Boost was originally designed for, I had to improvise using some engineering magic:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://theonlylars.com/images/posts/mintyboost/minty-boost-2.jpg">
This Eclipse mints container works perfectly for the Minty Boost, even if I did have to reverse the lid to get it to fit.</p>

<p>According to the battery rating, as well as the specs on the <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Teardown/3130/1#s15307">iPhone&#8217;s battery</a> and <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/power.html">Adafruit&#8217;s own website</a>, I should be able to get about half a charge on two high-capacity NiMH AA batteries (the green Energizers shown above):</p>

<p>Input: <code>2 * 1.2V * 2450mAh * 80% = 4704 mWh</code></p>

<p>Output: <code>4704mWh/5V * 80% = 753 mAh</code></p>

<p>Charges: <code>1420 mAh iPhone 4 Capacity / 753 mAh = ~1/2</code> charge of iPhone 4 on two fresh AA rechargeable batteries</p>

<p>Good enough, I say.</p>

    <id>http://theonlylars.com/blog/2012/05/29/wwdc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gettin&#8217; ready for <a href="http://www.apple.com/wwdc">dub dub</a> in less than two weeks! By my count, there are 42 &#8220;To be announced&#8221; sessions on the schedule released today. You will find me at as many Core Animation, Core Graphics, and GCD sessions as I can attend, as well as all of the cool new API sessions.  To make the most of it all, I&#8217;ve been trying to think of some good questions for the framework engineers at the labs.  I&#8217;ll probably get some feedback on my <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">ad controller</a>, as well as a new MBProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD-inspired HUD I&#8217;ve been working on at work, in addition to some other various work-related stuff.</p>

<p>Some new API&#8217;s stuffs I&#8217;m thinking/hoping we may see fill in the &#8216;to be announced&#8217; blanks during the keynote:</p>

<ol>
<li>Easier iCloud integration (don&#8217;t tell me you haven&#8217;t tried to integrate iCloud without issue)</li>
<li>Notification Center widgets (I would even settle for a useful Notification Center)</li>
<li>New maps APIs (<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/05/29/composite-mockup-of-ios-6-maps-app-based-on-purported-leaked-screenshots/">Exhibit A</a>)</li>
<li>More Core Image filters for iOS</li>
<li>Fully-baked Siri (I don&#8217;t necessarily think we&#8217;ll see app-level Siri integration, just yet)</li>
<li>Airplay<->Mac integration</li>
<li>Heck, I&#8217;m thinking there will be more generic OS-level mac-integration (think Airdrop)</li>
<li>More twitter-like account integrations</li>
<li>A new system-wide visual overhaul (not likely, but it&#8217;s been since iOS 4 that the look has changed in any way, and even that was minor)</li>
</ol>


<p>We&#8217;ll see how it all plays out.  I&#8217;ll be tweeting about it the whole time, NDA permitting, if you care to <a href="https://twitter.com/theonlylars">follow along</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to be joining us all, then I&#8217;ll see you there!</p>

    <link href="http://theonlylars.com/blog/2012/04/27/integrating-google-ads-with-iad/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-27T21:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://theonlylars.com/blog/2012/04/27/integrating-google-ads-with-iad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think Apple&#8217;s iAds had great potential.  But let&#8217;s face it.  They really aren&#8217;t pulling the weight they should.  When they do have inventory, however, they often make much more than any other ad service.  Let me show you how to not only quickly integrate iAds into your app, but do it properly all while using Google&#8217;s AdMob service as a backup.</p>

<p>If you watch Apple&#8217;s WWDC video on proper integration of iAd or read the iAd implementation documentation, you will see that they want you to use a single shared instance of your ads in all of your view controllers.  Since I also wanted that instance to be backed by Google ads when there was no iAd inventory, the best solution I could think of was the singleton.  This lead me to:</p>

<h2>Introducing <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a></h2>

<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a> in order to be a one-stop, single line integration of iAds (and later AdMob ads) into a <code>UIView</code>. I initially only supported iPods/iPhones in portrait orientation. It now has support for both iPods/iPhones as well as iPads in <em>any</em> orientation.</p>

<h2>Integrating <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>First, you will need to clone the source from <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">Github</a>:</p>

<p> <code>$ git clone git@github.com:larsacus/LARSAdController.git</code></p>

<p> or add it as a git submodule:</p>

<p> <code>$ git submodule add git@github.com:larsacus/LARSAdController.git Vendor/LARSAdController</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add folder or <code>LARSAdController.m/h</code> to your project</p></li>
<li>Download and copy the <a href="https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/download#downloadios">Google ad SDK</a> into your project and go ahead and sign up for a Google publisher account at <a href="https://admob.com">AdMob.com</a> if you haven&#8217;t already</li>
<li><p>Ensure the proper frameworks have been added to your application in order for iAds and AdMob ads to compile properly:</p>

<ol>
<li>iAd.framework</li>
<li>AudioToolbox.framework</li>
<li>MessageUI.framework</li>
<li>SystemConfiguration.framework</li>
</ol>


<p> You can add additional frameworks to your project in Xcode 4 by clicking on your project file in the project navigator on the left and going to <code>Build Phases &gt; Link Binary With Libraries &gt; Click + Symbol</code></p>

<p> Whew! What a lot of stupid setup and we haven&#8217;t even written any code, yet! If you want to write code, you may be a little disappointed by this post, because there really isn&#8217;t any.</p></li>
<li><p>Now go to <code>Product &gt; Build</code> or type &#8216;⌘+B&#8217; to build the project.  If your project builds without any errors, hurray! Skip to step 7.  If not, continue on&#8230;</p></li>
<li><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='F, no, Objective-C, I don&#8217;t want ARC on this file!'>If you have errors and you followed the above <em>and</em> you&#8217;re have ARC enabled, you will need to tell the compiler not to use ARC with <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a> as it is not supported, yet. Disable ARC on <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a> by following the same steps in step 4 to add frameworks to a project, but go to the <code>Compile Sources</code> section. Find <code>LARSAdController.m</code> in the list of files and double-click in the region to the right marked <code>Compiler Flags</code>. Add a new flag called <code>-fno-objc-arc</code>. A good way to remember this command is to read it like this: F, no, Objective-C, I don&#8217;t want ARC on this file!.  Moving along&#8230; Hit &#8216;⌘+B&#8217; to verify everything is building correctly. </span></li>
<li><em>Now</em> we&#8217;re ready to write some code! Get your typing fingers ready, because text doesn&#8217;t just copy/paste itself! Add the following two lines of code to one of your view controller&#8217;s view lifecycle load or appear methods.  I&#8217;ve found that <code>viewWillAppear:</code> seems to be the best when pushing/popping view controllers with ads on them:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nl">viewWillAppear:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">BOOL</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">animated</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">LARSAdController</span> <span class="n">sharedManager</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">addAdContainerToView:</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="nl">withParentViewController:</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">LARSAdController</span> <span class="n">sharedManager</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">setGoogleAdPublisherId:</span><span class="n">myPublisherId</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  If you are only supporting a single orientation, or a single set of orientations (portrait/upside down portrait), then you&#8217;re basically done.  Just add the first single line of code to any view controller that you want to host ads in. Just be sure to call <code>setGoogleAdPublisherId:</code> the first time you add LARSAdController to a view. The ads will automatically be added to the bottom of the view and appear/hide whenever they have inventory available.</p>

<h2>Multiple Orientations</h2>

<p>If you would like to support multiple orientations, you will need to add the following line to the first call you make to add LARSAdController to a view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">LARSAdController</span> <span class="n">sharedManager</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">setShouldHandleOrientationChanges:</span><span class="n">YES</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will automatically listen for orientation changes and adjust the ad accordingly! See how easy that was! I told you if you were looking to type code, you were going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Simply call the code in step 7 in any view you need the ad banner to be in, and it will automatically remove it from the old view and add it to the bottom of the new view.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think this is an extremely easy, proper way just to implement iAds into your app, even if you aren&#8217;t using AdMob ads.  If you&#8217;re registered to use AdMob ads, then it&#8217;s an even <em>more</em> efficient method, as it&#8217;s only one line of code more in order to integrate and you will <em>always</em> have an ad displaying in your app.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using <a href="https://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">LARSAdController</a> in your app, I&#8217;d love to know. You can send me an email if you can find it, <a href="http://github.com/larsacus/LARSAdController">fork the repo</a> and change the readme on GitHub, or even better, just send me a quick note at <a href="http://twitter.com/theonlylars">@theonlylars</a> and I&#8217;ll add it to the README file.</p>
