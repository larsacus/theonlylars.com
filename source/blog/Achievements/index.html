<p>Everyone makes at least some attempt at resolutions each new year - even if they say they "don't make resolutions". How can you go through life without goals to better yourself as a person? Based on my past, though, we very often do not write them down or forget about them entirely before the end of January.</p>
  
<p>The problem with goals of mine in the past have always been that they are very generic and/or very difficult to satisfy. I have made a deliberate effort to make my goals for this year both small and specific. This will make it much more difficult to justify my way out of satisfying my goals for this year and much easier to satisfy more goals is they are more achievable.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of both personal growth and gamification, I bring you my personal<sup id="footnote-1-source"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> list of "achievements" for 2013.</p>

<p>Achievements must be:<p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Specific</strong> - Specific goals have less room to be "justified" by you as "technically" completed. Examples include "Learn C", "Run More", etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantifiable</strong> - This goes with being specific. This makes it very clear as to the completion of your achievement. Did you &lt;insert achievement title&gt;? Yes? Then you did. Easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Achievable</strong> - If you're a brand new engineer now, your goal should <em>not</em> be to become director of your department this year.</li>
</ol>

<p>What are <em>your</em> 2013 achievements? Feel free to steal mine below if you so choose.</p>

        <h2>Visually Design Small Mac App</h2>
        <div>I would like to get into designing user interfaces instead of just being awesome at building them. I would at least like to have a general idea of <em>how</em> designers do what they do. This is my attempt at taking up more pure design-related tasks this year.</div>

        <div>It feels good, so I continue to do it. Doesn't matter the size of project, but I would prefer they not be single-method objective-c class categories or similarly small. My definition of "open-source" is <em>functional</em>, <em>public</em> and <em>useful</em> to others.</div>
