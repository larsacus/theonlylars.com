I've had this domain for awhile, but haven't had the time to build a website the way I like.  I wanted a blog that accepted markdown as text input, as well as some other social-media integration features, so imagine how intrigued I was to find [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which supported exactly this.  And since it's basically just a rack/sinatra app, it should be pretty easy for me to modify it how I want.

More to come.
