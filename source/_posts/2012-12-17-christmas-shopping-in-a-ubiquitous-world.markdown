I try to do all of my Christmas (holiday, whatever) shopping online. Going out in Austin traffic is a huge pain, especially when I get home from work way past dark. I'd rather hang out with my wife at home. For my wife and I, shopping for each other this year

1. 1Password
2. UPS Emails
3. iDevices left at home
4. Picking up packages
5. Amazon wishlists
