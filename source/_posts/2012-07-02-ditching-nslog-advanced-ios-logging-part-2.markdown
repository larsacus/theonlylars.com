#In Review
In [Part 1]() of this post, we introduced our good friend `NSLog` and why there is a time and a place for him, but those are few and far between.  We also discussed the different types of logging, and why you might want to use them, as well as how `NSLog` cannot satisfy these requirements.

In this post, we'll go over some of the options you have available in your developer tool-belt to make your life easier. I always tell myself that good tools (or even _the_ proper tool) make building things much easier.  The same is true for building an app as it is for building my new bike I have sitting in pieces in the garage. Obtain the right tools, and you'll be more likely to produce a solid product.
