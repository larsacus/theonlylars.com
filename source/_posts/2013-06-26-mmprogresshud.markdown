This morning I open-sourced a fun side-project I've been working on for the past (almost) two years - [MMProgressHUD](http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/06/20/mmprogresshud/). "Wow, that looks a lot like M*B*ProgressHUD!" Yes, astute pupil, not only is it in the same category of control, it shares 95% the same letters in the same order as MBProgressHUD. This was merely a coincidence since Mutual Mobile's official Objective-C class prefix is `MM`:

##From the Ground Up
MMProgressHUD was built from the ground up with a primary focus on animation, presentation and to cover the status bar. I also wanted a framework to easily add new animations and secondarily accept extremely basic user input. 

###Check It Out
If you're looking for a new HUD interface, just curious or merely want to check out the bits and peek under the hood, feel free to check out the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMProgressHUD). As always, if you find a bug or would like a new feature, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request!

##iOS 7
I've also got some fun things planned for MMProgressHUD and iOS 7 that I can't yet share publicly, but it will play _very_ nicely and fit right in with the new styling iOS 7 will bring. I can't wait.

##Up Next
This is one of two things I've been working to open-source recently. If I weren't on vacation right now, I'd be working on releasing the other. If you've ever been working on an early or prototype version of an app and needed to fill it with content, you'll really be excited about the next project I'll be releasing. It's nothing _too_ too exciting, but I hope others besides me find it really useful.
