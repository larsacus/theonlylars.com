Huge shout out to all the high schoolers at [Lorena High School](http://lorenaisd.net) that put up with my chatter about how cool my job is this morning. You guys were awesome.

If you're looking for the presentation, you can find it on [here on my github page](https://github.com/larsacus/career-day). It's available in powerpoint, keynote, and just plain old pdf. If you have any questions, you can [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theonlylars).
