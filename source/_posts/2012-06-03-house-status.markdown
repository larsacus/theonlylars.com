Just put up a new page that will be home to the status of all house gadgets that can have a status. Some things I'd eventually like to have in it are things like NAS status, A/C temperatures, ambient temperatures, light levels, computer status, electrical power consumption, etc. For now, all you're gonna get is a rant about how hot my apartment is.

Edit: We've moved - so I've dismantled the arduino temperature monitors and taken down the page.
