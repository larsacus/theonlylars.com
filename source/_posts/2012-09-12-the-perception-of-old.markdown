Today I turn 27. I am a software engineer at a growing mobile consultancy shop, and I often feel like I'm getting too "old" to have not accomplished something amazing already in my life. I see others who are my age or younger who seemed to have already accomplished so much either professionally or socially (in contributions).

Just go out and build. Really old mountain bikers.
